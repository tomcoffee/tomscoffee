**ALWAYS REMIX PROJECT** before editing. Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Showing 'next to the code' often times do not work if you are calling out elements and what-not, since it'll be inside an iframe built by glitch. Simply show in new window.

Server side code will mainly be built upon node.js.
